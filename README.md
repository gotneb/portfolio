# Portfolio

This portfolio is written using Flutter (Dart, precisely) and then transpiling to Javascript and HTML using Wasm.

```
$ flutter build web
```

That's it.

## Why not using conventional methods?

JavaScript, CSS, HTML are great tools, but I ❤️ building things in a different way, I like to explore
others alternatives, into another perspective view.

I found in Flutter another way to build sites, and there's nothing wrong with this approach.

But I'm not so naive to use this tool (Flutter is still growing, and has a lot to improve) to use in larges projects where performance counts.
